    <p>In lesson 9, we coded with HTML and used a couple of new skills such as unordered lists, and href attribute commands. I learned that unordered lists can be useful when trying to create a simple list, and href attribute commands can be used to create convenient shortcuts to other webpages. 
      When you combine both of these things with a couple of other extra elements, you can create a simple and convenient navigation page such as the one we made in this assignment. 
      I can apply this to my current environment when organizing various projects of mine or listing resources.</p>
