    <p>In this assignment I have chosen to do the IP address activity. 
      Personally, it was already previous knowledge, but you would have learned that you can change or “spoof” your IP address, which can be used to effectively fake your location to one of your choosing.
      To view your current IP (IPv4 being the most common form of IP addresses, and IPv6 being the more recent, updated version of IP formats) can be viewed online by using an IP address viewer. 
      You can put this to use by changing your IP to bypass geo-blocking, or to simply hide your real IP.</p>
