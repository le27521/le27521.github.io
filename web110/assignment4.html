    <p>For my first activity, I learned about email spoofing. Email spoofing is when emails are created when a forged email address. Email spoofing is commonly used to send scam and phishing emails to deceive recipients of said emails. 
These emails can be dangerous because such emails may contain ransomware and cause damage to businesses and individual people alike. Although there are some newer built in security measures to reduce email spoofing, this issue is not completely solved. 
I can apply this to my current and future environment by being more cautious for signs of email spoofing.


For my second activity, I researched internet mailing lists as well as bulk email restrictions. An internet mailing list is a list of email addresses of people that are interested in similar subjects. 
For example LISTGIANT and LeadIQ are a couple of popular mailing lists. For people that are mailing over 5,000 email addresses, there will bulk email restrictions. You must have an authenticated email, a feature that enables easy unsubscription to the subscribers.
 I can apply this to my future and current environment in case I am ever interested in joining a mail list and keeping the bulk email restrictions in mind if I ever send more than 5,000 emails.
