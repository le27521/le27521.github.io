    <p>For one of my activities, I downloaded the Brave browser and compared it to my main browser, Google Chrome. According to Brave, they have less ads and more security compared to other browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge. 
    When I compared Chrome and Brave, the latter did have less ads when I visited various web pages that usually have lots of ads. It also stops trackers from fetching your data from ads. 
    I can apply this to my current environment by switching browsers if I ever need a browser that has a built-in ad-blocker as well as a more secure and faster web browser.

      For my second activity, I chose to learn about chrome security features. The HTTPS indicator on a webpage will show up if you have a secure connection to the page. 
      An insecure HTTPS indicator on a webpage will show up if your connection is insecure, in which case you should be careful about going on/what you do on said page. 
      Additionally, you are able to enable/disable built in malware detection on Chrome if you ever need to do so. I can apply this to my current environment by toggling some of these features on/off if I need extra security when I am using chrome.
