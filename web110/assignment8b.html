    <p>For my first activity, I decided to review what exactly accessibility is through the Mozilla developer page. Accessibility is described as the practice of making your website as accessible to as many people as possible. Mozilla also says that accessibility is not only for people with disabilities, but people with slow connection, and people on mobile devices. Accessibility for web pages is a necessity in this day and age, since so many people of all ages and those able and disabled use the internet. I can apply this to my future environment when making a web page, to make it more accessible to everyone.

For my second activity, I decided to take a look at color palettes for web pages, using the website Paletton. Paletton makes it easy to see how different colors and color palettes would fit into a web page. From this I learned that it is better to keep the amount of different colors on a web page to a minimum, as too many different colors can distract the user and make the web page look unappealing. I can apply this to my future environment by making sure the color palette I use is monochrome or two different colors to keep the simplicity and accessibility of my page in check.
