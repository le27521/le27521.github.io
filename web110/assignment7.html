    <p>For my first activity, I chose to clear browser cache, history, and cookies. This is important to know how to do because if you have lots of cache, it can negatively affect the performance of your device as well as your devices storage, so it is important to clear your cache periodically. 
      You should also know how to clear your history as well if you need privacy. Clearing cookies is also important since doing that will protect your privacy by preventing websites from tracking your online activity, and lower the chance of being affected in security breaches. 
      I can apply this to my current and future environment if I ever have too much cache or unnecessary cookies active on my browser.
    
    For my second activity, I chose to download an anti malware software. I installed malwarebytes, mostly due to the good reviews and the simplicity of the software. 
      This program has a simple scan device button, and when there is malware detected, it gives specific information on what kind of malware it was (trojan, keylogger, etc.) and further information about different kinds of malwares that can infect your computer. 
      This can be helpful to my future and current environment because I can simply find and remove malware on my computer with this program.
