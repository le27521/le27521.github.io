    <p>During this semester, I learned many things about web development as well as the internet. I learned about the basics of HTML (lists, paragraphs, links), as well as CSS styling (color, font, backgrounds) along with more complicated things such as navigating SQL databses.
    These are all good things to know especially if you are going into the IT field. This class also helped me learn more in depth about programs we use daily, such as search engines, or social media. Overall, this was a very informational class that helped me gain a better understanding of the internet.</p>
