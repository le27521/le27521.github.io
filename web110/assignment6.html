    <p>For my first activity, I chose to research and compare the different license and support costs for different operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. For Windows 11, you can buy it directly from Microsoft for about $139, however there are cheaper alternatives to get license keys.
      You can also use Windows without an activated license, however some features will be unavailable. Windows support is usually at no cost, however professional support is pay per incident. 
      For Linux, the operating system is completely free to use and so is the support. macOS is exclusive to Apple Mac devices, with free support, however applecare does cost money. 
      I can apply this to my current and future environment by keeping the license and support costs in mind if I ever change operating systems.
    
    For my second activity, I chose to learn more about Wi-fi issues and troubleshooting them in Windows 10 and 11. Knowing these basic tips can help you troubleshoot any problems in the future that you have with your wifi or computer relating to wifi. 
     I can apply this knowledge to my current and future environment by knowing how to troubleshoot basic things relating to wifi such as restarting my router, and running network commands.</p>
