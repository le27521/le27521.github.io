    <p>For my assignment 15, I chose to complete the LinkedIn activity. LinkedIn is a social network app/website where people can find jobs or business opportunities. 
      I learned that having a LinkedIn is important because you can apply for jobs easily, as well as let employers know your specific skills and your resume quickly and easily. 
      I also learned that LinkedIn allows you to post your own job listings and filter through jobs to meet your specific interests. 
      I can use this in my current environment to look for jobs because this platform allows for simple or more refined job searching based on what you are searching for.
