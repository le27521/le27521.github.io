    <p>In the activity where I compared four search engines: Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask, I came to a conclusion that the search engine with the best user interface was Google. 
      Google has a much more simpler and less cluttered interface compared to the other three search engines. Google also utilizes AI for your searches, which can give you quick answers and also provides links with sources. 
      Using my preferred browser, I looked up “search engine market share” and Google currently has the most, with over 80%. 
      I can use this information to my current and future environment by utilizing the AI overview which can be helpful since it provides links to sources you can use.

      For my second activity, I used the Internet Archive. I have used this before and it comes in handy when trying to access a previous version of a page or a website that no longer exists, but has been archived on the Wayback Machine. 
      This is useful since anyone can archive web pages that they may find important for future use, or simply for archival purposes. 
      I can apply this to my future and current environment if I am ever in a situation where I need to access a web page that has been taken down or trying to view older versions of a certain page.</p>
