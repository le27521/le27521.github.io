    <p class="p1"> In assignment 9, I learned about various tools in CSS which help add more to a web page. This includes the specific commands needed to change the background color of a website, the color of texts, and even the font of texts in a web page. 
      We also were able to learn about style sheets, which use references to change style of webpages. Two other types of CSS include: inline and external CSS, which you can directly change a style of an element in the HTML itself.
      This can become useful to make a web page stick out more as well as make it more appealing to a user which I can use in my future environment.
