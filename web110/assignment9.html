    <p class="p1"> In assignment 9, I learned about various tools in CSS which help add more to a web page. This includes the specific commands needed to change the background color of a website, the color of texts, and even the font of texts in a web page. 
      This comes in handy to make a web page stick out more as well as make it more appealing to a user which I can use in my future environment.
