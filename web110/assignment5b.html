    <p>For this activity I chose to do research on peer to peer file sharing. Peer to peer file sharing (P2P) is a convenient way to let two or more people share files directly. 
      P2P file sharing is commonly used to share music, videos, and software, however it can be used illegally where users will redistribute software and other media illegally, which called for previously popular P2P sharing sites to be taken down and investigated by the FBI. 
      Nevertheless, more modern versions of P2P file sharing have been available for a while now, and operate in a way that makes it significantly harder to take down services.
