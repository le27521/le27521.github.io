    <p>For my first activity, I decided to evaluate popular social media networking sites based on their level of support for each of the blocks of the honeycomb model. 
      The honeycomb model is a tool that helps one understand how social media works. This includes basic functionalities such as privacy features for users, advertising tools, communities, how easy it is to join conversations, to more advanced things like a content management system and social graphs. 
      I believe that Facebook and Reddit are the only social media platforms out of the 9 that fully support the honeycomb model. You can apply this to your future environment by checking these qualities off while evaluating social media sites to make sure the site fits your needs. 

      Social networking means grouping together individuals and businesses to connect through a medium to share information, ideas, etc. Some social media sites that interest me are Instagram, mainly due to the fact that the main idea for Instagram is posting 1:1 photos. One more social networking site that interests me is LINE. 
      LINE interests me mainly because of the amount of customizability there is for the user, and the ability to access lots of different emoticons made by artists. 
      I can apply this to my future environment in case I ever switch my messaging app.
